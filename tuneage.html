        <p>This is a deliberately indulgent selection of summer grooves.</p>
        <p>Iman Omari's “Energy” popped up on my Spotify on the first truly glorious day of my time in Manhattan. Walking around Union Square with this vibing in my headphones reminded me how much I love his silky production and effortlessly blended vocals. Watch out for more from his catalogue in future playlists.</p>
        <p>Theo Croker, in a live performance, says “This Could Be...” is about being on the road and feeling like maybe, just maybe, your temporary life in this new place with new people could be your “real” life. That groove is just nuts.</p>
        <p>Patrice Rushen (aka the female Quincy/Stevie who really should have the same level of recognition) is at her groovy, virtuoso best on a track I first heard in sample form on a Jazzy Jeff mixtape.</p>
        <p>That's just the first three. Honestly, these tunes all sizzle. Bon été!</p>

      <div class="col-md-8"> <h2>005</h2> <h3>May 2017</h3>

        <p>Chantae Cann’s infectious scat and Ashley Henry’s prodigious piano seem like perfect bookends this month, both tunes move effortlessly between time signatures and almost mock the very idea of structure in places.</p>

        <p>Lorine Chia delivers the ultimate get-out-of-my-face bad mood anthem with “I Just Want to Live”. Definitely my mood music right now.</p>

        <p>MNDSGN may be a terrible singer live, but the dude can arrange. His melodic brand of lo-fi chillwave is on display here with Lather.</p>

        <p>Oh, and the one Bombay Bicycle Club song I ever listened to.</p>

      <div class="col-md-8"> <h2>004</h2> <h3>April 2017</h3>

        <p>I wasn't too sure what I wanted to do this month—create a playlist of tunes I felt were truly transcendent, or a bunch of tunes that felt like the were about transcendence. In the end, I've done neither. Instead, here are a collection of tunes I hope transmit a number of different feelings, because I think ultimately our ability to experience different things is the reason any of this can exist.
        </p>
        <p>Zero7's End Theme shows up ironically early here, a classic orchestral-yet-still-regular-music anthem for days when you need to feel epic. Chris McClenney's Untitled (Funk#2) feels like a Jamaica Funk rewrite, yet brings something new. Tigran Hamasyan beasts out completely on Ancient Observer (how's that for transcending?), and Kaminsky  brings it home with a sweet, jazzy rendition of a Daft Punk hit.</p>

            <p>There are some incredible instrumentalists on display—GoGo Penguin are a jazz trio like few other, mixing hyperactive, often glitchy riffs into their songs. Uyama Hiroto, a dear friend, collaborator, and de-facto spiritual successor to the late, great Nujabes, sizzles on clarinet. L’impératrice, a funky electronic outfit from the nation that brought you Daft Punk, show their sensitive, worldly side on this acoustic reimagining.</p>

            <p>For all that, possibly my favourite cut here comes from Alfa Mist, a UK producer making his debut on the other side of the studio glass. Backed by what sounds like a jazz three-piece, his flow is effortless but relentless at the same time. Bars.</p>

              genius/demon child/alien Jacob Collier can play and sing pretty much
              anything. Often, the stuff that comes out of such otherworldly talents can
              be a bit too complex for my mere mortal ears. I think he keeps it just
              about simple enough on “Hideaway”, despite multiple time and key signature
              shifts.</p>

              <p>Anderson .Paak was pretty hard to avoid in 2016. “Am I Wrong” (ft.
                Schoolboy Q) was arguably his biggest banger. But this tune also
                features two of my personal faves—Pomo produced the beat, and
                Brasstracks laid down some tasty trumpet grooves.</p>

                <p>Erroll Garner’s rendition of “Sunny” has everything that made him so
                  great—playfulness, lightning fast fingers, and an unbelievable ear for
                  melody. His grunting along to the track somehow makes it better.</p>

                  <p>For whatever reason, the song I really wanted to end this playlist
                    with is no longer available on Spotify. If you're so inclined, feel free
                    to listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnx-cIXO07U">“Colours” by The
                      Cinematic Orchestra</a> once the playlist is finished. A beautiful
