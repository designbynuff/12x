          <p>I was at a coffee shop playing all Badu, all the time. It was glorious. If you don't feel like listening to this playlist, do that instead.</p>

          <p>With the exception of Erykah and Q-Tip, I discovered every other artist on this playlist through Spotify. It's kind of insane how much my listening habits have changed since I switched to streaming.</p>

          <p>Setting the mood for some downtime as we see the year out. A perfect playlist for gazing out of a window at a world you'd rather not get involved with right now.</p>

          <p>That said, there are a lot of interesting rhythms going on here, from the double-time ghost notes of Gogo Penguin and Rohey, to the triple taps of Vicente Amigo and Lydian Collective, not to mention Fink's slow shuffle. Lots of table tapping opportunities here.</p>

        the song playing in the background is, you know it's fuego. Enjoy Hypnotic Brass Ensemble's beautifully bouncy
        anthem, Linden.</p>

        <p>The gliding melody of Koto Song was stuck in my head for a whole weekend, causing me to search my entire Spotify history to find it. Totally worth it for that hit of bittersweet bliss.</p>

        <p>A quick word for Cid Rim, Dorian Concept, and The Clonius—three Austrian childhood friends turned underground electronic music megastars. Four Eighteen gives you a taste of the sensibilities and musical approach of each, but definitely dive deeper into each artist's discography.</p>

        though, there is no better way to start this month's playlist than with
        MXXWLL's vibes.</p> <p>Royksopp's deubt album, Melody AM, changed the
        way I hear music. Their quasi-tangible soundscapes helped me “see”

        you're in North America) just a few weeks ago. Then again, eclipses
        happen all the time.</p> <p>The rest of the playlist is similarly given

        <p>Phonte's "Something" reminds me of early morning starts in New York

        seemed endlessly mysterious yet vaguely familiar.</p> <p>Right in the

        seriously groovy, experimental, jazz/funk/hop. Oh, and Cappo has
        bars.</p>

        the exception of the opener, which I've been meaning to throw on a
        playlist for a few months. Menahan Street Band's "The Crossing" is a
        classic soul joint released by a bunch of New Yorkers in 2012, and you
        can definitely hear a bit of Jay-Z in here (as well as he obvious Dr.
        Dre similarity in the opening riff).</p> <p>"Godzilla" by Velis Trio is
        such a delightfully... abstract piece of music. Listening to it, I feel
        like I'm in a dream where the laws of physics no longer apply.</p>
        <p>CAPYAC's "Disco Muse" veers into guilty pleasure territory—it's a
        pretty sugary track with a kind of Daft Punk meets Norah Jones vibe.</p>

        <!--Body Text --> <p>This is a deliberately indulgent selection of
        summer grooves.</p> <p>Iman Omari's “Energy” popped up on my Spotify on
        the first truly glorious day of my time in Manhattan. Walking around
        Union Square with this vibing in my headphones reminded me how much I
        love his silky production and effortlessly blended vocals. Watch out for
        more from his catalogue in future playlists.</p> <p>Theo Croker, in a
        live performance, says “This Could Be...” is about being on the road and
        feeling like maybe, just maybe, your temporary life in this new place
        with new people could be your “real” life. That groove is just nuts.</p>
        <p>Patrice Rushen (aka the female Quincy/Stevie who really should have
        the same level of recognition) is at her groovy, virtuoso best on a
        track I first heard in sample form on a Jazzy Jeff mixtape.</p>

        <p>Chantae Cann’s infectious scat and Ashley Henry’s prodigious piano
        seem like perfect bookends this month, both tunes move effortlessly
        between time signatures and almost mock the very idea of structure in
        places.</p>

        <p>Lorine Chia delivers the ultimate get-out-of-my-face bad mood anthem
        with “I Just Want to Live”. Definitely my mood music right now.</p>

        <p>MNDSGN may be a terrible singer live, but the dude can arrange. His

        <p>I wasn't too sure what I wanted to do this month—create a playlist of
        tunes I felt were truly transcendent, or a bunch of tunes that felt like
        the were about transcendence. In the end, I've done neither. Instead,
        here are a collection of tunes I hope transmit a number of different
        feelings, because I think ultimately our ability to experience different
        things is the reason any of this can exist. </p> <p>Zero7's End Theme
        shows up ironically early here, a classic
        orchestral-yet-still-regular-music anthem for days when you need to feel
        epic. Chris McClenney's Untitled (Funk#2) feels like a Jamaica Funk
        rewrite, yet brings something new. Tigran Hamasyan beasts out completely
        on Ancient Observer (how's that for transcending?), and Kaminsky  brings
        it home with a sweet, jazzy rendition of a Daft Punk hit.</p>

            <p>There are some incredible instrumentalists on display—GoGo
            Penguin are a jazz trio like few other, mixing hyperactive, often
            glitchy riffs into their songs. Uyama Hiroto, a dear friend,
            collaborator, and de-facto spiritual successor to the late, great
            Nujabes, sizzles on clarinet. L’impératrice, a funky electronic
            outfit from the nation that brought you Daft Punk, show their
            sensitive, worldly side on this acoustic reimagining.</p>

            <p>For all that, possibly my favourite cut here comes from Alfa
            Mist, a UK producer making his debut on the other side of the studio
            glass. Backed by what sounds like a jazz three-piece, his flow is
            effortless but relentless at the same time. Bars.</p>

            <p>Musical genius/demon child/alien Jacob Collier can play and sing
            pretty much anything. Often, the stuff that comes out of such
            otherworldly talents can be a bit too complex for my mere mortal
            ears. I think he keeps it just about simple enough on “Hideaway”,
            despite multiple time and key signature shifts.</p>

              <p>Anderson .Paak was pretty hard to avoid in 2016. “Am I Wrong”
              (ft. Schoolboy Q) was arguably his biggest banger. But this tune
              also features two of my personal faves—Pomo produced the beat, and
              Brasstracks laid down some tasty trumpet grooves.</p>

                <p>Erroll Garner’s rendition of “Sunny” has everything that made
                him so great—playfulness, lightning fast fingers, and an
                unbelievable ear for melody. His grunting along to the track
                somehow makes it better.</p> </div>
